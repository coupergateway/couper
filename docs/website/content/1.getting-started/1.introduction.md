# Introduction

Couper is a lightweight open-source API gateway that acts as an entry point for clients to your application (frontend API gateway) and an exit point to upstream services (upstream API gateway).

It adds access control, observability, and back-end connectivity on a separate layer. This will keep your core application code more simple.

Couper does not need any special development skills and offers easy configuration and integration.

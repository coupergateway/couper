# JWT

The `jwt` block lets you configure JSON Web Token access control for your gateway.
Like all [access control](/configuration/access-control) types, the `jwt` block is defined in
the [`definitions` Block](/configuration/block/definitions) and can be referenced in all configuration blocks by its
required _label_.

Since responses from endpoints protected by JWT access controls are not publicly cacheable, a `Cache-Control: private` header field is added to the response, unless this feature is disabled with `disable_private_caching = true`.

| Block name | Context                                               | Label            |
|:-----------|:------------------------------------------------------|:-----------------|

::

The attributes `bearer`, `cookie`, `header` and `token_value` are mutually exclusive.
If all four attributes are missing, `bearer = true` will be implied, i.e. the token will be read from the incoming `Authorization: Bearer ...` header.

**Deprecation Note:** Configuring `header = "Authorization"` to read from the incoming `Authorization: Bearer ...` header is **deprecated**. Use `bearer = true` instead.

If the key to verify the signatures of tokens does not change over time, it should be specified via either `key` or `key_file` (together with `signature_algorithm`).
Otherwise, a JSON web key set should be referenced via `jwks_url`; in this case, the tokens need a `kid` header.

A JWT access control configured by this block can extract permissions from

- the value of the claim specified by `permissions_claim` and
- the result of mapping the value of the claim specified by `roles_claim` using the `roles_map`.

The `jwt` block may also be referenced by the [`jwt_sign()` function](/configuration/functions), if it has a `signing_ttl` defined. For `HS*` algorithms the signing key is taken from `key`/`key_file`, for `RS*` and `ES*` algorithms, `signing_key` or `signing_key_file` have to be specified.

> **Note:** A `jwt` block with `signing_ttl` cannot have the same label as a `jwt_signing_profile` block.

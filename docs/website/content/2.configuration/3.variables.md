# Variables

The configuration file allows the use of some predefined variables. There are two phases when those variables get evaluated.
The first phase is at config load which is currently related to `env` and simple **function** usage.
The second evaluation will happen during the request/response handling.

- `env` are the environment variables
- `request` is the client request
- `backend_requests` contains all modified backend requests
- `backend_responses` contains all original backend responses

See [variables reference](./REFERENCE.md#variables) for details.

About _beta_ features
=============================

We use _beta_ features to have the possibility to develop new, complex features for you while still being able to maintain our compatibility promise.

You can see beta features as a feature preview. We will announce new beta features in the [Changelog](/CHANGELOG.md) and document them in the [reference](REFERENCE.md).

We will keep features in beta as long as we collect feedback and are actively working on it. You can expect beta features to evolve.

_They can change with every release._

We recommended you to pin Couper to a specific [docker tag](https://hub.docker.com/r/avenga/couper/tags) to avoid unintended updates. (Add tests to your code to make sure that nothing is going to break when you want to update to a newer version).

To make you and your colleagues aware that a beta feature is used, we will prefix all configuration items such as config blocks or functions with `beta_`:

Feedback more than welcome!
-------------------------------

We need your feedback to make beta features to proper features. Please leave your feedback and questions [here](https://github.com/avenga/couper/discussions), or open an issue. Thank you! :)

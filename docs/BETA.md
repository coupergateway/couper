# What's a 'beta' Feature?

We introduced 'beta' feature in order to keep our feature warranty and still develop new complex features for you.

## What 'beta' means for you

In practice, a 'beta' feature is:

- one that our team is still actively working on
- is prefixed with `beta_`
- going to evolve, so it is recommended to pin the current docker tag (please add tests to your code to make sure that nothing is going to break when you want to update to a newer version)
- documented in the changelog

## Feedback more than welcome

We need your feedback to bring 'beta' features to public. So please leave your feedback and questions [here](https://github.com/avenga/couper/discussions). Thank you! :)
